# MavenMultiModuleParent

###### Multi Module Maven has advantages that Parent can host common services like logging, JUnit etc.

###### Children can express dependencies amongst each other.

##### We also tried Site and UML generation, along with UBER Jar using a child module that depends on other modules.
To create UBER Jar we can use shade plugin Or Assembly, I prefer assembly.

Please refer to change lists / checkin comments  to get the summary.
